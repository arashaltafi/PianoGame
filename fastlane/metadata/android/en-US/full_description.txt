Have a baby curious about shiny tablets and phones? Use this app as a
baby-game and, more importantly, to prevent random taps of a baby from
doing anything you may not want.

This app will show a small piano a baby can use to explore sounds in a
mobile device. At the same time, it will block any naive attempts at
closing the app. The back, home and apps-menu buttons will be blocked,
and Android's top menu won't be available.

This ensures a baby can't accidentally close the game, preventing any
actions on the device you may not want.

Grown ups can unlock the app by touching the settings icon with one
finger, then holding the second setting icon with another finger.
